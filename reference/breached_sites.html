Whilst some of the data had previously been seen in Have I Been Pwned, 2,844 of the files consisting of more than 80 million unique email addresses had not previously been seen. Each file contained both an email address and plain text password and were consequently loaded as a single &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot; data breach.

In their disclosure, 8Tracks advised that &amp;quot;the vector for the attack was an employee’s GitHub account, which was not secured using two-factor authentication&amp;quot;. Salted SHA-1 password hashes for users who &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; sign up with either Google or Facebook authentication were also included. The data was provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies and contained almost 8 million unique email addresses.

The site &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/who-ran-leakedsource-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;allegedly had an administrator in common with the nefarious LeakedSource site&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have since been shut down. The exposed data included more than 1.3 million unique email addresses, often accompanied by usernames, IP addresses and plain text or hashed passwords retrieved from various sources and intended to be used to compromise the victims' accounts.

The data was being actively traded on underground forums and included email addresses, birth dates and passwords.

A provider of &amp;quot;Fresh Quality Contacts&amp;quot;, the service exposed over 9.3M unique records of individuals and employer information including their names, employers, job titles, contact information and data relating to the employer including organisation description, size and revenue. No response was received from Adapt when contacted.

The password cryptography was poorly done and &lt;a href="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;many were quickly resolved back to plain text&lt;/a&gt;. The unencrypted hints also &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disclosed much about the passwords&lt;/a&gt; adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.

The data dump included extremely sensitive personal information about individuals and their relationship statuses and sexual preferences combined with personally identifiable information.

The data contained names, email addresses, dates of birth and passwords stored as &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; MD5 hashes and plain text. AFF did not respond when contacted about the breach and the site was previously reported as compromised on the &lt;a href="https://vigilante.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vigilante.pw&lt;/a&gt; breached database directory.

Acquired by InMobi earlier in the year, the AerServ breach impacted over 66k unique email addresses and also included contact information and passwords stored as salted SHA-512 hashes. The data was publicly posted to Twitter later in 2018 after which InMobi was notified and advised they were aware of the incident.

The breach included a raft of personal information on registered users plus despite assertions of not distributing personally identifiable information, the site also leaked the IP addresses used by the registered identities.

Discovered by researchers at The Kromtech Security Center, the 577GB data set included extensive personal information including over 20 million unique email addresses, social media profiles and address book contacts. The email addresses alone were provided to HIBP to enable impacted users to assess their exposure.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email addresses and MD5 password hashes. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The full contents of the emails were subsequently &lt;a href="https://wikileaks.org/akp-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published by WikiLeaks and made searchable&lt;/a&gt;. HIBP identified over 917k unique email address patterns in the data set, including message IDs and a number of other non-user addresses.

The compromised data included email addresses, user birth dates and passwords stored as a salted MD5 hash.

The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for &amp;quot;credential stuffing&amp;quot;, that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password.

#&gt; 24           In July 2018, the sales engagement startup &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apollo-breach-linkedin-salesforce-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apollo left a database containing billions of data points publicly exposed without a password&lt;/a&gt;. The data was discovered by security researcher &lt;a href="http://www.vinnytroia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vinny Troia&lt;/a&gt; who subsequently sent a subset of the data containing 126 million unique email addresses to Have I Been Pwned. The data left exposed by Apollo was used in their &amp;quot;revenue acceleration platform&amp;quot; and included personal information such as names and email addresses as well as professional information including places of employment, the roles people hold and where they're located. Apollo stressed that the exposed data did not include sensitive information such as passwords, social security numbers or financial data. &lt;a href="https://www.apollo.io/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Apollo website has a contact form&lt;/a&gt; for those looking to get in touch with the organisation.

The breached data was found being regularly traded online and included usernames, email and IP addresses and MD5 passwords.

The attackers threatened Ashley Madison with the full disclosure of the breach unless the service was shut down. One month later, the database was dumped including more than 30M unique email addresses. This breach has been classed as &amp;quot;sensitive&amp;quot; and is not publicly searchable, although individuals may discover if they've been impacted by &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe"&gt;registering for notifications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/07/heres-how-im-going-to-handle-ashley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read about this approach in detail&lt;/a&gt;.

The site provided tips on fraudulently obtaining goods and services, often by providing a legitimate "PID" or Product Information Description. The breach resulted in nearly 6k user accounts and over 220k private messages between forum members being exposed.

The incident exposed 846k email addresses and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes. When contacted in October 2018, Baby Names advised that &amp;quot;the breach happened at least ten years ago&amp;quot; and that members were notified at the time.

Likely obtained several years earlier, the data contained 112 million unique email addresses with personal data including names, birthdates and passwords stored as MD5 hashes. Whilst there are many indicators suggesting Badoo did indeed suffer a data breach, &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-unverified-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the legitimacy of the data could not be emphatically proven&lt;/a&gt; so this breach has been categorised as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;.

Containing 213k unique email addresses and plain text passwords, the data was provided to HIBP by a third party. Multiple attempts were made to contact BannerBit, but no response was received.

The passwords were stored as MD5 hashes with no salt and many were easily converted back to their plain text versions.

The data was consequently leaked online with a message from the attacker stating that they were &amp;quot;releasing a significant portion of Bell.ca's data due to the fact that they have failed to cooperate with us&amp;quot; and included a threat to leak more. The impacted data included over 2 million unique email addresses and 153k survey results dating back to 2011 and 2012. There were also 162 Bell employee records with more comprehensive personal data including names, phone numbers and plain text &amp;quot;passcodes&amp;quot;. Bell suffered another breach in 2014 which exposed 40k records.

A collection of various sites running on the same service were also compromised and details of the hack (including links to the data) were posted on a popular forum. In all, more than 3.2k unique email addresses were included alongside usernames, IP addresses, dates of birth, genders and bcrypt hashes of passwords.

Whilst originally stating that only usernames and passwords had been exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.databreaches.net/data-from-2014-hack-of-childrens-online-game-bin-weevils-leaked-online-hacker-claims-20m-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a subsequent story on DataBreaches.net indicated that a more extensive set of personal attributes were impacted&lt;/a&gt; (comments there also suggest the data may have come from a later breach). Data matching that pattern was later provided to Have I been pwned by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/akshayindia6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@akshayindia6&lt;/a&gt; and included almost 1.3m unique email addresses, genders, ages and plain text passwords.

The hack of their forum led to the exposure of almost 1.9 million accounts along with usernames, email addresses and salted SHA1 passwords.

The database from the IP.Board based forum contained 445k accounts including usernames, email and IP addresses and salted MD5 password hashes.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email and IP addresses, user names and MD5 password hashes. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The breached data was then posted online by the attackers who claimed it was a subset of a larger data breach totalling 6.6 million records. The leaked data was extensive and included names, physical, email and IP addresses, genders and birth dates, account balances and passwords stored as plain text.

Allegedly taken from a combination of the main Coachella website and their vBulletin-based message board, the data included almost 600k usernames, IP and email addresses and salted hashes of passwords (MD5 in the case of the message board).

The data contained almost 2.7 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; records including 773 million unique email addresses alongside passwords those addresses had used on other breached services.

A further 27k accounts appeared with home addresses with the entire data set being sold on underground forums.

Shortly after, &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/07/philippine_voter_data_breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data on 55 million Filipino voters was leaked publicly&lt;/a&gt; and included sensitive information such as genders, marital statuses, height and weight and biometric fingerprint data. The breach only included 228k email addresses.

On further investigation, the file was also found to contain data indicating it had been sourced from &lt;a href="https://armorgames.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Armor Games&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent verification with HIBP subscribers confirmed the passwords had previously been used and many subscribers had used either Coupon Mom or Armor Games in the past. On disclosure to both organisations, each found that the data did not represent their entire customer base and possibly includes records from other sources with common subscribers. The breach has subsequently been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot; as the source cannot be emphatically proven.

Upon further investigation, the data was linked to marketing company &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180925092401/https://www.datanleads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Data &amp;amp; Leads&lt;/a&gt;. The exposed Elasticsearch instance contained over 44M unique email addresses along with names, IP and physical addresses, phone numbers and employment information. No response was received from Data &amp;amp; Leads when contacted by Bob and their site subsequently went offline.

The seller claimed the data was sourced from Experian and whilst that claim was rejected by the company, the data itself was found to be legitimate suggesting it may have been sourced from other legitimate locations. In total, there were more than 8 million unique email addresses in the data which also contained a raft of other personal attributes including credit ratings, home ownership status, family structure and other fields described in the story linked to above. The email addresses alone were provided to HIBP.

The phpBB based forum had 1,508 unique email addresses exposed in the breach alongside forum posts, private messages and passwords stored as weak salted hashes. The data breach was self-submitted to HIBP by the forum operator.

The data contained email and IP addresses, usernames, plain text passwords and dietary information about the site members including eating habits, BMI and birth date. The site was previously reported as compromised on the &lt;a href="https://vigilante.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vigilante.pw&lt;/a&gt; breached database directory.

The service ceased running shortly afterwards and no information remains about the precise nature of it. Based on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1045178309926051840" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;enquiries made via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it appears to have been a mail service possibly based on PowerMTA and used for delivering spam. The logs contained information including 7.7M unique email recipients (names and addresses), mail server IP addresses, email subjects and tracking information including mail opens and clicks.

The breach dated back to July 2012 but wasn't identified until years later when the data finally surfaced. The breach contained over 17.5 million unique email addresses and usernames. Users who created logins on Disqus had salted SHA1 hashes of passwords whilst users who logged in via social providers only had references to those accounts.

Along with the keys used to redeem and activate games on the Steam platform, the breach also resulted in the exposure of email addresses, birth dates and salted MD5 password hashes. The data was donated to Have I been pwned by data breach monitoring service &lt;a href="https://vigilante.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vigilante.pw&lt;/a&gt;.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;.

In August 2016, &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/dropbox-forces-password-resets-after-user-credentials-exposed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;they forced password resets for customers they believed may be at risk&lt;/a&gt;. A large volume of data totalling over 68 million records &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/hackers-stole-over-60-million-dropbox-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was subsequently traded online&lt;/a&gt; and included email addresses and salted hashes of passwords (half of them SHA1, half of them bcrypt).

One of those datasets was an Elasticsearch instance on AWS containing sales lead data and 5.8M unique email addresses. The data contained information relating to individuals and the companies they worked for including their names, email addresses and company name and contact information. Despite best efforts, it was not possible to identify the owner of the data hence this breach as been titled &amp;quot;Elasticsearch Sales Leads&amp;quot;.

Almost 1.4 million unique accounts were found circulating in late 2016 which contained a raft of personal information ranging from email addresses to phone numbers to plain text passwords. Whilst many HIBP subscribers confirmed their data was legitimate, the actual source of the breach remains inconclusive. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-data-breach-investigation-blow-by-blow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A detailed account of the data has been published&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of identifying the origin of the breach.

The Estonian police suspected the email addresses and passwords they obtained were being used to access mailboxes, cryptocurrency exchanges, cloud service accounts and other similar online assets. They've requested that individuals who find themselves in the data set &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;and also identify that cryptocurrency has been stolen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; contact them at &lt;a href="mailto:cybercrime@politsei.ee"&gt;cybercrime@politsei.ee&lt;/a&gt;.

Emails were sent prior to launch containing passwords in plain text and the site allowed anyone to download utility bills without sufficient authentication. Various methods of customer data enumeration was possible and phishing attacks began appearing the day after launch.

The school had identified a data breach which had occurred sometime between 6 May 2016 and 12 Feb 2018 and an XML file containing 368k student records was subsequently found circulating. Each record contained student name, date of birth, password, grade, email &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; parent email resulting in a total of 543k unique email addresses. Due to the prevalence of email addresses belonging to individuals who are still legally children, the data breach has been flagged as &amp;quot;sensitive&amp;quot;.

The attack was attributed to the Syrian Electronic Army, allegedly as retribution for a perceived "Hate of Syria". The attack not only leaked user credentials, but also resulted in the posting of fake news stories to forbes.com.

The attack allegedly took down 20% of dark web sites running behind Tor hidden services with the attacker claiming that of the 10,613 impacted sites, more than 50% of the content was child pornography. The hack led to the exposure of MySQL databases for the sites which included a vast amount of information on the hidden services Freedom Hosting II was managing. The impacted data classes far exceeds those listed for the breach and differ between the thousands of impacted sites.

The attack which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Survela/status/463327706361659392" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been &lt;a href="http://pastebin.com/ipFKjv6z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;orchestrated by Deletesec&lt;/a&gt; who claim that "Digital weapons shall annihilate all secrecy within governments and corporations". The exposed data included password stored in plain text.

The incident was disclosed to Funny Games in July who acknowledged the breach and identified it had been caused by legacy code no longer in use. The record count in the breach constitute approximately half of the user base.

The data contained usernames, email and IP addresses, genders, the city of users as well as passwords stored in both plain text and as MD5 hashes. The site was previously reported as compromised on the &lt;a href="https://vigilante.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vigilante.pw&lt;/a&gt; breached database directory.

The site later &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamModio/status/756705841168916486" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shut down in July 2016&lt;/a&gt; but was identified as having been hosted on a vBulletin forum. The exposed data included usernames, email and IP addresses and salted MD5 hashes.

Information about Gawkers 1.3M users was published along with the data from Gawker's other web presences including Gizmodo and Lifehacker. Due to the prevalence of password reuse, many victims of the breach &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/why-your-apps-security-design-could.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;then had their Twitter accounts compromised to send Acai berry spam&lt;/a&gt;.

The breached data was originally scraped from GitHub in violation of their terms of use and contained information exposed in public profiles, including over 1 million members' email addresses. Full details on the incident (including how impacted members can see their leaked data) are covered in the blog post on &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/8-million-github-profiles-were-leaked-from-geekedins-mongodb-heres-how-to-see-yours" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;8 million GitHub profiles were leaked from GeekedIn's MongoDB - here's how to see yours&lt;/a&gt;.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email and IP addresses, user names and salted and hashed passwords. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

An extensive amount of personal information on customers was obtained including names, addresses, phone numbers, purchases and passwords and answers to security questions stored as MD5 hashes. In a small number of cases, passport, social security numbers and partial credit card data was also exposed. The data breach and source code belonging to GoldSilver was publicly posted on a dark web service where it remained months later. When notified about the incident, GoldSilver advised that &amp;quot;all affected customers have been directly notified&amp;quot;.

The site later merged into the &lt;a href="http://www.webzen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Webzen portal&lt;/a&gt; where the original accounts still exist today. The exposed data included usernames, email and IP addresses, MD5 hashes and personal attributes such as gender, birth date, physical address and security questions and answers stored in plain text.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains usernames, email addresses and salted MD5 password hashes and was provided to HIBP by white hat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The compromised data included email addresses, geographical locations, birthdates and salted hashes of passwords.

The vBulletin forum included IP addresses, birth dates and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked. A further 368k accounts were added to &amp;quot;Have I been pwned&amp;quot; in March 2016 bringing the total to over 2.4M.

The data spanned multiple separate breaches including &lt;a href="https://www.jobstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the JobStreet jobs website&lt;/a&gt; which contained almost 4 million unique email addresses. The dates in the breach indicate the incident occurred in March 2012. The data later appeared freely downloadable on a Tor hidden service and contained extensive information on job seekers including names, genders, birth dates, phone numbers, physical addresses and passwords.

The exposed data was from iJoomla and JomSocial, both services that &lt;a href="https://www.joomlart.com/blog/joomlart-acquires-ijoomla-and-jomsocial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JoomlArt acquired the previous year&lt;/a&gt;. The data included usernames, email addresses, purchases and passwords stored as MD5 hashes. When contacted, JoomlArt advised they were aware of the incident and had previously notified impacted parties.

Comprised of over 24 million records, the data contained various personal attributes such as email addresses, dates of birth and physical locations. However, upon verification with HIBP subscribers, only a fraction of the data was found to be accurate and no account owners recalled using the Justdate.com service. This breach has consequently been flagged as &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-fabricated-data-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fabricated&lt;/a&gt;; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Justdate.com.

The operator of the service contacted HIBP to report the data which, upon further investigation, turned out to be a large credential stuffing list.

The breach contained almost 5.2 million unique email addresses, usernames and salted SHA1 hashes of passwords.

The vBulletin forum contained over half a million accounts including usernames, email and IP addresses and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes.

Allegedly protesting &amp;quot;the foreign policy of Russia in regards to Ukraine&amp;quot;, KM.RU was one of several Russian sites in the breach and impacted almost 1.5M accounts including sensitive personal information.

The data belonging to the now defunct service appeared in JSON format and contained gigabytes of data related to the real estate and insurance sectors. The personal data in the breach appears to have primarily been used for marketing purposes, including logs of emails sent and tracking of gift cards. A small number of passwords for KnownCircle staff were also present and were stored as bcrypt hashes.

The data contained 45k names, email addresses, usernames and plain text passwords. A Lanwar staff member self-submitted the breach to HIBP and has also contacted the relevant authorities about the incident after identifying a phishing attempt to extort Bitcoin from a user.

Whilst &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/passwordsecurity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Last.fm knew of an incident back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the scale of the hack was not known until the data was released publicly in September 2016. The breach included 37 million unique email addresses, usernames and passwords stored as unsalted MD5 hashes.

At the time, the service had more than 32 million registered accounts and the breach affected various personal data attributes including &amp;quot;encrypted&amp;quot; passwords. In 2018, a 339k record subset of the data emerged with email addresses, usernames and plain text passwords, likely cracked from the original cryptographically protected ones.

The incident reported by Softpedia had allegedly taken place earlier in the year, although the data set sent to HIBP was dated as recently as early September but contained only 2 million subscribers. The data included usernames, email and IP addresses and SHA512 hashes. A further 3 million accounts were obtained and added to HIBP several days after the initial data was loaded bringing the total to over 5 million.

Lifeboat knew of the incident for three months before the breach was made public but elected not to advise customers. The leaked data included usernames, email addresses and passwords stored as straight MD5 hashes.

Originally hacked in 2012, the data remained out of sight until being offered for sale on a dark market site 4 years later. The passwords in the breach were stored as SHA1 hashes without salt, the vast majority of which were quickly cracked in the days following the release of the data.

Running on an old version of vBulletin, the breach also disclosed usernames, IP addresses and salted MD5 password hashes. Linux Forums did not respond to multiple attempts to contact them about the breach.

Shortly thereafter, the service &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/another-lizard-arrested-lizard-lair-hacked/"&gt;suffered a data breach&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the public disclosure of over 13k user accounts including passwords stored in plain text.

The data later appeared listed for sale in June 2016 and included 1.1 million usernames, email and IP addresses, birth dates and plain text passwords.

The data was being actively traded on underground forums and included email addresses, birth dates and password hashes.

Lounge Board was a MyBB forum launched in 2012 and discontinued in mid 2013 (the last activity in the logs was from August 2013).

The vBulletin-based system exposed over 326k usernames, email and IP addresses, dates of birth and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes. The data was later discovered being traded on a popular hacking forum. Mac Forums did not respond when contacted about the incident via their contact us form.

The passwords were hashed with MD5 and no salt.
#&gt; 181                                                                                                    In September 2014, several large dumps of user accounts appeared on the &lt;a href="https://forum.btcsec.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Russian Bitcoin Security Forum&lt;/a&gt; including one with nearly 5M email addresses and passwords, predominantly on the mail.ru domain. Whilst &lt;a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2014/09/10/russia-email-yandex-mailru-passwords-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;unlikely to be the result of a direct attack against mail.ru&lt;/a&gt;, the credentials were confirmed by many as legitimate for other services they had subscribed to. Further data allegedly valid for mail.ru and containing email addresses and plain text passwords was added in January 2018 bringing to total to more than 16M records. The incident was also then flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;, a concept that was &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-unverified-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;introduced after the initial data load in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.

The accounts were being actively sold and traded online and included email addresses, salted password hashes and IP addresses.

Whilst passwords were stored as hashes, &lt;a href="https://pulse.michalspacek.cz/passwords/storages/site/www.mall.cz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a number of different  algorithms of varying strength were used over time&lt;/a&gt;. All passwords included in the publicly distributed data were in plain text and were likely just those that had been successfully cracked (members with strong passwords don't appear to be included). According to MALL.cz, the breach only impacted accounts created before 2015.

The incident also exposed usernames, the geographic location of the user and passwords stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes. No response was received from Mappery when contacted about the incident.
#&gt; 188                                                                                                                                         In March 2017, a 27GB database backup file named "Master Deeds" was sent to HIBP by a supporter of the project. Upon detailed analysis later that year, the file was found to contain the personal data of tens of millions of living and deceased South African residents. The data included extensive personal attributes such as names, addresses, ethnicities, genders, birth dates, government issued personal identification numbers and 2.2 million email addresses. At the time of publishing, &lt;a href="https://www.iafrikan.com/2017/10/18/dracore-data-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;it's alleged the data was sourced from Dracore Data Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (Dracore is yet to publicly confirm or deny the data was sourced from their systems). On 18 October 2017, the file was found to have been published to a publicly accessible web server where it was located at the root of an IP address with directory listing enabled. The file was dated 8 April 2015.

The data contained email exchanges between MDPI and their authors and reviewers which included 845k unique email addresses. MDPI have confirmed that the system has since been protected and that no data of a sensitive nature was impacted. As such, they concluded that notification to their subscribers was not necessary due to the fact that all their authors and reviewers are available online on their website.

The database contained over 58M unique email addresses along with IP addresses, names, home addresses, genders, job titles, dates of birth and phone numbers. The data was subsequently &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/hacker-steals-58-million-user-records-from-data-storage-provider-509190.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;attributed to &amp;quot;Modern Business Solutions&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, a company that provides data storage and database hosting solutions. They've yet to acknowledge the incident or explain how they came to be in possession of the data.

A file containing 570k email addresses and cracked passwords was subsequently distributed online. A larger more complete file containing 607k email addresses with original unsalted MD5 password hashes along with names, usernames and physical addresses was later provided and the original breach in HIBP was updated accordingly. The data was provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies.

The data included extensive personal information relating to home financing including personal contact info, credit statuses, household incomes, loan amounts and notes on personal circumstances, often referring to legal issues, divorces and health conditions. Multiple parties contacted HIBP with the data after which MyFHA was alerted in mid-July and acknowledged the legitimacy of the breach then took the site offline.

Cydia is designed to facilitate the installation of apps on jailbroken iOS devices. The repository service was allegedly hacked by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/its_not_herpes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@its_not_herpes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/0x8badfl00d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;0x8badfl00d&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for the service refusing to remove pirated tweaks.

In May 2016 the data was offered up for sale on the &amp;quot;Real Deal&amp;quot; dark market website and included email addresses, usernames and SHA1 hashes of the first 10 characters of the password converted to lowercase and stored without a salt. The exact breach date is unknown, but &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dating-the-ginormous-myspace-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis of the data suggests it was 8 years before being made public&lt;/a&gt;.

The breach included data from numerous systems with various personal identity attributes, the largest of which had passwords stored as easily crackable MD5 hashes. There were 1.4 million unique email addresses in the breach.

The data consisted of a large volume of emails sent to the service and included almost 3.5M unique addresses, albeit many of them auto-generated. Multiple attempts were made to contact the operators of NemoWeb but no response was received.

Allegedly hacked &amp;quot;several years earlier&amp;quot;, the data contains sensitive personal information including birthdates, genders and names as well as almost 27 million unique email addresses. Passwords were stored in plain text and IP addresses were also present in the breach.

Whilst there is evidence that the data itself is legitimate (multiple HIBP subscribers confirmed a password they use is in the data), due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email addresses and plain text passwords. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The company was contacted by local Brazilian media outlet Tecmundo and subsequently advised that &lt;a href="https://www.tecmundo.com.br/seguranca/125038-netshoes-invadida-meio-milhao-dados-clientes-vazam-internet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no indications have been identified of an invasion of the company's systems&lt;/a&gt;. However, Netshoes' own systems successfully confirm the presence of matching identifiers and email addresses from the data set, indicating a high likelihood that the data originated from them.

The incident was made public some 9 months later in April 2016 when the documents appeared publicly on a file sharing site. Analysis of the breached data suggests &lt;a href="http://blog.trendmicro.co.uk/qatar-bank-breach-lifts-the-veil-on-targeted-attack-strategies/#more-520" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the attack began by exploiting a SQL injection flaw&lt;/a&gt; in the bank's website.

The attack impacted 28 separate sites, predominantly technology forums such as &lt;a href="http://quinstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;flashkit.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://quinstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;codeguru.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://quinstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;webdeveloper.com&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://pastebin.com/raw/6p50GgCV" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;view a full list of sites&lt;/a&gt;). QuinStreet advised that impacted users have been notified and passwords reset. The data contained details on over 4.9 million people and included email addresses, dates of birth and salted MD5 hashes.

The vBulletin forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked. A further 11M accounts were added to "Have I been pwned" in March 2016 and another 9M in July 2016 bringing the total to over 22M.

The data set provided to Have I been pwned included 91M unique usernames (which also form part of Rambler email addresses) and plain text passwords. According to Rambler, the data dates back to March 2014.

The data contained 7.4 million unique email addresses along with names, employers, phone numbers and job titles in a table called &amp;quot;us_emails&amp;quot;. When contacted and advised of the incident, RankWatch would not reveal the purpose of the data, where it had been acquired from and whether the data owners had consented to its collection. The forum which originally posted the data explained it as being &amp;quot;in the same vein as the modbsolutions leak&amp;quot;, &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#ModernBusinessSolutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a large list of corporate data allegedly used for spam purposes&lt;/a&gt;.

The personal data of almost 25k people was impacted by the breach and included names, email addresses and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The website has since gone offline with a message stating that &amp;quot;Rbx.Rocks v2.0 is currently under construction&amp;quot;.

The data contained real estate listings including addresses and the names, phone numbers and 308k unique email addresses of the sellers. Real Estate Mogul was advised of the incident in September 2018 and stated that they &amp;quot;found no instance of user account credentials like usernames and passwords nor billing information within this file&amp;quot;.
#&gt; 253 In July 2016, a tweet was posted with a link to an alleged data breach of &lt;a href="http://bluesnap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;BlueSnap, a global payment gateway and merchant account provider&lt;/a&gt;. The data contained 324k payment records across 105k unique email addresses and included personal attributes such as name, home address and phone number. The data was verified with multiple Have I been pwned subscribers who confirmed it also contained valid transactions, partial credit card numbers, expiry dates and CVVs. A downstream consumer of BlueSnap services known as &lt;a href="http://www.regpacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Regpack&lt;/a&gt; was subsequently identified as the source of the data after they identified human error had left the transactions exposed on a publicly facing server. A full investigation of the data and statement by Regpack is detailed in the post titled &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/someone-just-lost-324k-payment-records-complete-with-cvvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Someone just lost 324k payment records, complete with CVVs&lt;/a&gt;.

The attack involved &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/01/searching-snapchat-data-breach-with.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brute force enumeration of a large number of phone numbers&lt;/a&gt; against the Snapchat API in what appears to be a response to Snapchat's assertion that such an attack was &amp;quot;theoretical&amp;quot;. Consequently, the breach enabled individual usernames (which are often used across other services) to be resolved to phone numbers which users usually wish to keep private.

The breaches spanned various areas of the business ranging from the PlayStation network all the way through to the motion picture arm, Sony Pictures. A SQL Injection vulnerability in &lt;a href="http://www.sonypictures.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sonypictures.com&lt;/a&gt; lead to &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/06/brief-sony-password-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of accounts across multiple systems being exposed&lt;/a&gt; complete with plain text passwords.

Collected surreptitiously whilst the targets were using their devices, the data included photos, audio recordings, text messages and browsing history which were then exposed via a number of misconfigurations within SpyFone's systems. The data belonged the thousands of SpyFone customers and included 44k unique email addresses, many likely belonging to people the targeted phones had contact with.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;.

Whilst the actual date of the exploit is not clear, the breached data includes usernames, email addresses, IP addresses and salted hashes of passwords. A further 584k records were added from a more comprehensive breach file provided in October 2016.

The attacker allegedly requested a ransom to share details of the vulnerability with Ticketfly but did not receive a reply and subsequently posted the breached data online to a publicly accessible location. The data included over 26 million unique email addresses along with names, physical addresses and phone numbers. Whilst there were no passwords in the publicly leaked data, &lt;a href=https://support.ticketfly.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2941983-ticketfly-cyber-incident-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ticketfly later issued an incident update&lt;/a&gt; and stated that &amp;quot;It is possible, however, that hashed values of password credentials could have been accessed&amp;quot;.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email addresses and user names. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The attack lead to the release of both forum user and customer accounts totalling almost 519k records. The breach included email addresses, birth dates, security questions and answers for customers and salted hashes of passwords for both sources.

The Hong Kong company produces learning products for children including software sold via the compromised website. The data breach exposed extensive personal details including home addresses, security questions and answers and passwords stored as weak MD5 hashes. Furthermore, children's details including names, ages, genders and associations to their parents' records were also exposed.

Whilst the data set was titled V-Tight, within there were &lt;a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/pN7nyjJ7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;50 other (predominantly wellness-related) domain names&lt;/a&gt;, most owned by the same entity. Multiple HIBP subscribers confirmed that although they couldn't recall providing data specifically to V-Tight, their personal information including name, phone and physical address was accurate. V-Tight Gel did not reply to multiple requests for comment.

Allegedly due to a SQL injection flaw in Drupal, the attack exposed usernames, email addresses and data in a "pass" column which adheres to the salted SHA12 password hashing pattern used by Drupal 7. Digital Extremes (the developers of Warframe), asserts the salted hashes are of "alias names" rather than passwords.

Containing a total of over 66M records, the owner of the data couldn't be identified but it is believed to have been scraped from LinkedIn hence the title &amp;quot;You've Been Scraped&amp;quot;. The exposed records included names, both work and personal email addresses, job titles and links to the individuals' LinkedIn profiles.

The data was consequently redistributed online and contains email addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes of passwords (the password hash was not present on all accounts). This data was provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies.

Comprised of almost 53 million records, the data contained email addresses and plain text passwords. However, during extensive verification in May 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-how-i-verify-data-breaches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;no evidence could be found that the data was indeed sourced from the dating service&lt;/a&gt;. This breach has consequently been flagged as &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-fabricated-data-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fabricated&lt;/a&gt;; it's highly unlikely the data was sourced from Zoosk.

The vBulletin forum contained 4.9 million accounts including usernames, email addresses and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes.

Intended to be a site for expressing anonymous opinions, the leaked data included email addresses, birth dates and other personally identifiable data about almost 3.5 million unique email addresses found in the leak.
