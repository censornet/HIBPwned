Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;.

The password cryptography was poorly done and &lt;a href="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;many were quickly resolved back to plain text&lt;/a&gt;. The unencrypted hints also &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disclosed much about the passwords&lt;/a&gt; adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.

The data dump included extremely sensitive personal information about individuals and their relationship statuses and sexual preferences combined with personally identifiable information.

The breach included a raft of personal information on registered users plus despite assertions of not distributing personally identifiable information, the site also leaked the IP addresses used by the registered identities.

The compromised data included email addresses, user birth dates and passwords stored as a salted MD5 hash.

The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for &amp;quot;credential stuffing&amp;quot;, that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password.

The breached data was found being regularly traded online and included usernames, email and IP addresses and MD5 passwords.

The attackers threatened Ashley Madison with the full disclosure of the breach unless the service was shut down. One month later, the database was dumped including more than 30M unique email addresses. This breach has been classed as &amp;quot;sensitive&amp;quot; and is not publicly searchable, although individuals may discover if they've been impacted by &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe"&gt;registering for notifications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/07/heres-how-im-going-to-handle-ashley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read about this approach in detail&lt;/a&gt;.

The site provided tips on fraudulently obtaining goods and services, often by providing a legitimate "PID" or Product Information Description. The breach resulted in nearly 6k user accounts and over 220k private messages between forum members being exposed.

Likely obtained several years earlier, the data contained 112 million unique email addresses with personal data including names, birthdates and passwords stored as MD5 hashes. Whilst there are many indicators suggesting Badoo did indeed suffer a data breach, &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-unverified-breaches-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the legitimacy of the data could not be emphatically proven&lt;/a&gt; so this breach has been categorised as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;.

The passwords were stored as MD5 hashes with no salt and many were easily converted back to their plain text versions.

The data was consequently leaked online with a message from the attacker stating that they were &amp;quot;releasing a significant portion of Bell.ca's data due to the fact that they have failed to cooperate with us&amp;quot; and included a threat to leak more. The impacted data included over 2 million unique email addresses and 153k survey results dating back to 2011 and 2012. There were also 162 Bell employee records with more comprehensive personal data including names, phone numbers and plain text &amp;quot;passcodes&amp;quot;. Bell suffered another breach in 2014 which exposed 40k records.

The attack resulted in the &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/BigMoneyJobs-Hacked-Details-of-36-000-Users-Leaked-Online-436250.shtml?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=information_security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exposure of over 36,000 user accounts&lt;/a&gt; including email addresses, usernames and passwords which were stored in plain text. The attack was allegedly mounted by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability.

Whilst commonly reported as 5M &amp;quot;Gmail passwords&amp;quot;, the dump also contained 123k yandex.ru addresses. Whilst the origin of the breach remains unclear, the breached credentials were &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140910190920/http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/2fz13q/5_millions_of_gmail_passwords_leaked_rus_most/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed by multiple source as correct&lt;/a&gt;, albeit a number of years old.

The attackers obtained the entire vBulletin MySQL database and promptly posted it for download on the Boxee forum itself. The data included 160k users, password histories, private messages and a variety of other data exposed across nearly 200 publicly exposed tables.

Almost 1.4 million unique accounts were found circulating in late 2016 which contained a raft of personal information ranging from email addresses to phone numbers to plain text passwords. Whilst many HIBP subscribers confirmed their data was legitimate, the actual source of the breach remains inconclusive. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-data-breach-investigation-blow-by-blow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A detailed account of the data has been published&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of identifying the origin of the breach.

Emails were sent prior to launch containing passwords in plain text and the site allowed anyone to download utility bills without sufficient authentication. Various methods of customer data enumeration was possible and phishing attacks began appearing the day after launch.
