The data was sold and traded before 000webhost was alerted in October. The breach included names, email addresses and plain text passwords.

Whilst some of the data had previously been seen in Have I Been Pwned, 2,844 of the files consisting of more than 80 million unique email addresses had not previously been seen. Each file contained both an email address and plain text password and were consequently loaded as a single &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot; data breach.

The breach of the vBulletin message board impacted over 17k individual users and exposed email addresses, usersnames and salted MD5 passwords.

In their disclosure, 8Tracks advised that &amp;quot;the vector for the attack was an employee’s GitHub account, which was not secured using two-factor authentication&amp;quot;. Salted SHA-1 password hashes for users who &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; sign up with either Google or Facebook authentication were also included. The data was provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies and contained almost 8 million unique email addresses.

The data contained email and IP addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes of passwords.

The site &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/who-ran-leakedsource-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;allegedly had an administrator in common with the nefarious LeakedSource site&lt;/a&gt;, both of which have since been shut down. The exposed data included more than 1.3 million unique email addresses, often accompanied by usernames, IP addresses and plain text or hashed passwords retrieved from various sources and intended to be used to compromise the victims' accounts.

The data was being actively traded on underground forums and included email addresses, birth dates and passwords.

The password cryptography was poorly done and &lt;a href="http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;many were quickly resolved back to plain text&lt;/a&gt;. The unencrypted hints also &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/11/adobe-credentials-and-serious.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disclosed much about the passwords&lt;/a&gt; adding further to the risk that hundreds of millions of Adobe customers already faced.

The data dump included extremely sensitive personal information about individuals and their relationship statuses and sexual preferences combined with personally identifiable information.

The breach included a raft of personal information on registered users plus despite assertions of not distributing personally identifiable information, the site also leaked the IP addresses used by the registered identities.

Discovered by researchers at The Kromtech Security Center, the 577GB data set included extensive personal information including over 20 million unique email addresses, social media profiles and address book contacts. The email addresses alone were provided to HIBP to enable impacted users to assess their exposure.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email addresses and MD5 password hashes. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The full contents of the emails were subsequently &lt;a href="https://wikileaks.org/akp-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published by WikiLeaks and made searchable&lt;/a&gt;. HIBP identified over 917k unique email address patterns in the data set, including message IDs and a number of other non-user addresses.

The breach was not discovered until late 2017 when a file containing almost 300k email addresses and plain text passwords was identified.

The compromised data included email addresses, user birth dates and passwords stored as a salted MD5 hash.

The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems.

The attackers threatened Ashley Madison with the full disclosure of the breach unless the service was shut down. One month later, the database was dumped including more than 30M unique email addresses. This breach has been classed as &amp;quot;sensitive&amp;quot; and is not publicly searchable, although individuals may discover if they've been impacted by &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe"&gt;registering for notifications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/07/heres-how-im-going-to-handle-ashley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read about this approach in detail&lt;/a&gt;.

The site provided tips on fraudulently obtaining goods and services, often by providing a legitimate "PID" or Product Information Description. The breach resulted in nearly 6k user accounts and over 220k private messages between forum members being exposed.

The data was consequently leaked online with a message from the attacker stating that they were &amp;quot;releasing a significant portion of Bell.ca's data due to the fact that they have failed to cooperate with us&amp;quot; and included a threat to leak more. The impacted data included over 2 million unique email addresses and 153k survey results dating back to 2011 and 2012. There were also 162 Bell employee records with more comprehensive personal data including names, phone numbers and plain text &amp;quot;passcodes&amp;quot;. Bell suffered another breach in 2014 which exposed 40k records.

A collection of various sites running on the same service were also compromised and details of the hack (including links to the data) were posted on a popular forum. In all, more than 3.2k unique email addresses were included alongside usernames, IP addresses, dates of birth, genders and bcrypt hashes of passwords.

The attack resulted in the &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/BigMoneyJobs-Hacked-Details-of-36-000-Users-Leaked-Online-436250.shtml?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=information_security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exposure of over 36,000 user accounts&lt;/a&gt; including email addresses, usernames and passwords which were stored in plain text. The attack was allegedly mounted by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability.

Whilst originally stating that only usernames and passwords had been exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.databreaches.net/data-from-2014-hack-of-childrens-online-game-bin-weevils-leaked-online-hacker-claims-20m-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a subsequent story on DataBreaches.net indicated that a more extensive set of personal attributes were impacted&lt;/a&gt; (comments there also suggest the data may have come from a later breach). Data matching that pattern was later provided to Have I been pwned by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/akshayindia6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@akshayindia6&lt;/a&gt; and included almost 1.3m unique email addresses, genders, ages and plain text passwords.

Whilst there has been no public attribution of the breach, the leaked data included over 227k accounts and nearly 10k private messages between users of the forum.

The hack of their forum led to the exposure of almost 1.9 million accounts along with usernames, email addresses and salted SHA1 passwords.

The database from the IP.Board based forum contained 445k accounts including usernames, email and IP addresses and salted MD5 password hashes.

Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot;. The data in the breach contains email and IP addresses, user names and MD5 password hashes. &lt;a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I been pwned.&lt;/a&gt;

The breached data was then posted online by the attackers who claimed it was a subset of a larger data breach totalling 6.6 million records. The leaked data was extensive and included names, physical, email and IP addresses, genders and birth dates, account balances and passwords stored as plain text.

Allegedly taken from a combination of the main Coachella website and their vBulletin-based message board, the data included almost 600k usernames, IP and email addresses and salted hashes of passwords (MD5 in the case of the message board).

A further 27k accounts appeared with home addresses with the entire data set being sold on underground forums.

Shortly after, &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/07/philippine_voter_data_breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data on 55 million Filipino voters was leaked publicly&lt;/a&gt; and included sensitive information such as genders, marital statuses, height and weight and biometric fingerprint data. The breach only included 228k email addresses.

On further investigation, the file was also found to contain data indicating it had been sourced from &lt;a href="https://armorgames.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Armor Games&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent verification with HIBP subscribers confirmed the passwords had previously been used and many subscribers had used either Coupon Mom or Armor Games in the past. On disclosure to both organisations, each found that the data did not represent their entire customer base and possibly includes records from other sources with common subscribers. The breach has subsequently been flagged as &amp;quot;unverified&amp;quot; as the source cannot be emphatically proven.
