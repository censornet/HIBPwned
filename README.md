Utilising the [HaveIBeenPwned.com API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2), check whether email addresses and/or user names have been present in a publicly disclosed data breach.

## Examples

If you want a list of the breaches where your email address has been included, use the `account_breaches()` function with `truncate = TRUE`.

`account_breaches("steff.sullivan@gmail.com", truncate = TRUE)`

The code is vectorized, so you can search more than one account at a time. Results are organized by email address.

`account_breaches(c("steff.sullivan@gmail.com","stephanie.g.locke@gmail.com"), truncate = TRUE)`

If you want more data, set `truncate` to `FALSE` or leave it out.

`account_breaches(c("steff.sullivan@gmail.com","stephanie.g.locke@gmail.com"))`

For additional information about a given breach, use `breached_site()` with the name you saw from `account_breaches()`.

`breached_site("Adobe")`
